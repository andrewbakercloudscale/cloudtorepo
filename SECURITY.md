## Scope

CloudtoRepo is a collection of Bash scripts that call the AWS CLI and Terraform on your
local machine using your own credentials. It does not run as a service, store credentials,
or make network calls beyond what the AWS CLI and Terraform do normally.

Relevant security considerations:

- **Generated files** (`imports.tf`, `backend.tf`, `generated.tf`) may contain resource IDs,
  ARNs, and configuration details. Treat them as sensitive and do not commit them to public
  repositories without review.
- **State files** (`terraform.tfstate`) contain full resource configuration including secrets.
  Always use a private S3 backend with encryption enabled (`--state-bucket`).
- **Cross-account role assumption** (`--role`) uses short-lived STS credentials. Ensure the
  IAM role has the minimum required read-only permissions.
